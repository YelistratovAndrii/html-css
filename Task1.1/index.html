          Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5
          May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to
          prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful
          campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the de facto leader of
          the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804. As Napoleon I,
          he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815.
          Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade
          while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic
          Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles,
          building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its
          final collapse in 1815. He was one of the greatest military commanders
          in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied in military schools
          worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured, and
          he has been one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in
          world history.

      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>1769</b>- Napoleon born in Corsica</li>
        <li>
          <b>1785</b>- Napoleon joins the French military, becoming an artillery
          officer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1787–95</b>- The French Revolution begins, and Napoleon sides with
          the revolutionaries. in 1793 is promoted to brigadier general. In 1795
          a new constitution in France places executive power in a five-member
          Directory. Napoleon becomes a respected adviser on military matters to
          the Directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1796–99</b>- Napoleon marries Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, the
          widow of General Alexandre de Beauharnais, in March 1796. He
          subsequently leads French forces to a series of victories against the
          Austrians in northern Italy. He negotiates the Treaty of Campo Formio
          in 1797. He attempts to conquer Egypt (1798–99) but is defeated by the
          British under Horatio Nelson in the Battle of the Nile. Unrest at home
          leads Napoleon to return to France.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1799</b>- Napoleon joins a plot that overthrows the Directory on
          November 9–10 (18–19 Brumaire in the French republican calendar). This
          event is often considered the effective end of the French Revolution.
          A new government, the Consulate, is established, and Napoleon is made
          first consul, or leader of France.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1800</b>- A victory over Austria at the Battle of Marengo leaves
          France the dominant power on the continent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1803</b>- In need of money, Napoleon sells the Louisiana Territory
          to the United States, abandoning the idea of a French empire in North
          America.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1804</b>- Napoleon’s numerous reforms in government include the
          Napoleonic Code, the French civil code enacted on March 21 that
          clarifies and makes uniform the laws of France. He also reconstructs
          the French education system. Napoleon declares France a hereditary
          empire and crowns himself emperor under the name Napoleon I.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1805–09</b>- At the Battle of Trafalgar on October 21, 1805, the
          British fleet under Nelson destroys the French navy. From this point
          on Napoleon will focus on land battles. He wins major victories in the
          Battles of Ulm and Austerlitz (1805), Jena and Auerstädt (1806), and
          Friedland (1807) against an alliance of Russia, Austria, Sweden, and
          Prussia. The battles are part of what come to be known as the
          Napoleonic Wars. The resulting Treaties of Tilsit (1807) and the
          Treaty of Schönbrunn (1809) leave most of Europe, from the English
          Channel to the Russian border, either part of the French Empire,
          controlled by France, or allied to it by treaty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1809–11</b>- After divorcing Joséphine (who did not have any
          children with Napoleon) in 1809, Napoleon marries Marie-Louise,
          daughter of the emperor of Austria, in 1810. On March 20, 1811,
          Marie-Louise bears him a son, the future duke von Reichstadt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1812</b>- Tsar Alexander I of Russia refuses to abide by Napoleon’s
          policy forbidding trade with Britain. Napoleon begins an ill-fated
          invasion of Russia. He reaches Moscow in September but finds the city
          abandoned. A huge fire breaks out that same day, destroying the
          greater part of the town. Since it is impossible to winter in the
          ruined city, Napoleon begins a retreat in October across the
          snow-covered plains. The retreat from Moscow is one of the great
          disasters of military history. Of the some 600,000 troops who had set
          out with Napoleon’s Grand Army in June, fewer than 10,000 men fit for
          combat remained with his main force by November.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1813–14</b>- The Battle of Leipzig (October 1813) results in the
          destruction of what is left of French power in Germany and Poland.
          Napoleon is forced to withdraw west of the Rhine River. Allied forces
          invade France, capturing Paris on March 30, 1814. Napoleon is forced
          to abdicate on April 6 and is forced into exile on the island of Elba,
          off the west coast of Italy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1815</b>- Napoleon manages to muster a force and returns to France
          to reestablish himself as emperor for the Hundred Days, but he is
          decisively defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18. Four days
          later, Napoleon abdicates for the last time. He is exiled again, this
          time to Saint Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean.
        </li>
        <li><b>1821</b>- Napoleon dies on Saint Helena.</li>
